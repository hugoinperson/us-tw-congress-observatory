/*!
 * There are 4 different environments:
 * (1) local: 			This environment enable module hot reload and other local development related features.
 * 									There's no build required for this environment. Webpack bundles are served from memory.
 * 									[ Use webpack-dev-server to serve the app ]
 *
 * (2) development: This environment requires running a build script before starting the app. However, this
 * 									build won't minimize and uglify any code. Also, redux-logger will still be enabled for
 * 									generating helpful console logs.
 * 									[ Use normal express to serve the app ]
 *
 * (3) staging: 		This is a pre-`roduction environment. The build script will minimize and uglify the code,
 * 									and nosources-source-map will be used to hide the sour`e content. From this environment
 * 									and above, stricter eslint rules will be used. The difference between staging and production
 * 									is staging used pre-production data store.
 * 									[ Use normal express to serve the app ]
 *
 * (4) production:  Has the same webpack setting and quality of build files as in staging environment. Use
 * 									production data store.
 * 									[ Use normal express to serve the app ]
